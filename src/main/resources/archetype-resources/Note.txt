Because of a Maven Bug a file like ".gitignore" will not be copied automatically.
Whatever there are several descriptions of this problem on the web and also some workarounds that does not work.

Therefore, the ".gitignore" file will be copied/created without the leading dot.
It is up to you to rename the file "gitignore" to ".gitignore" ...

After that feel free to delete this file.
